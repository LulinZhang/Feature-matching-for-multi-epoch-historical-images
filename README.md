# Introduction

Historical imagery is characterized by high spatial resolution and stereoscopic acquisitions, providing a valuable resource for recovering 3D land-cover information. Accurate geo-referencing of diachronic historical images by means of self-calibration remains a bottleneck because of the difficulty to find sufficient amount of feature correspondences under evolving landscapes. As shown in Figures XX, YYY current *state-of-the-art* feature matching methods (including SIFT [^1] and SuperGlue [^2]) perfom well on images acquired within the same epoch (also refered to as intra-epoch). Yet, due to drastic scene changes and heterogeneous acquisition conditions, they underperform to find feature correspondences across different epochs (also referred to as inter-epoch).

In this work we propose a fully automatic approach to computing dense and robust inter-epoch feature correspondences. Our method consists of a rough co-registration by finding feature correspondences between DSMs derived within single epochs, and a precise feature matching on original RGB images. Our main contributions include:
* By matching DSMs, we are able to obtain robust rough co-registration as the 3D landscape often stays globally stable over time.
* Under the guidance of co-registered orientations and DSMs, we reduce the difficulty in precise matching by: (1) narrowing down the search space; (2) reducing the combinatorial complexity since only overlapping images are analyzed;
* By proposing a tiling scheme (including  one-to-many tiling in rough co-registration andone-to-one tiling in precise matching), we are opening up the possibility to scale-up the deep learning methods for feature matching. As we have shown [^3], using them out-of-the-box is inefficient. Large images demand high computing resources, while deep learning feature extraction methods are presumably trained on small images.
* By including priors about the geometry (in form of DSMs), we can filter candidate correspondences: each three correspondences projected to DSM serve to compute a 3D Helmert transformation between epochs, and most importantly provide a 2D constraint on all images' correspondences.
 



However, it is very challenging to recover correspondences in historical images taken at different time (also refered to as inter-epoch) due to:

* Drastic scene changes
* Low radiometric quality
* Deformation caused by scaning

Below we display an inter-epoch image pair as well as the correspondences recovered by SIFT, SuperGlue and Ours.

 

SIFT recovered 0 correspondence. It is reasonable because SIFT is not sufficiently invariant over time.

The result of SuperGlue seems not bad. However, the details revealed poor precision. This is not acceptable for high precision ground survey.

Our method is capable to recover a large number of precise correspondences. The details will be introduced in section "Methodology".

# Methodology

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/flowchart.png" width="800">
</p>

<p align="center">
Figure. Full processing workflow
</p>

Our pipeline consists of 3 parts of processing: intra-epoch, inter-epoch and combined.

In the intra-epoch part, we process each epoch individually to get the image orientations and DSM.

The inter-epoch part is the key point of our pipeline. It is a rough-to-precise matching strategy.

In the combined processing, we use the correspondences to refine the orientations.

The details of the inter-epoch processing are explained below:

## Rough co-registration

Based on the image orientations and DSM from each epoch, we first match the DSMs to roughly co-register the 2 epochs.

As SuperGlue provides unsatisfactory result on large images and it is not invariant to rotations larger than 45â—¦, we introduce tiling scheme and rotation hypotheses to improve the performance of SuperGlue.

We display an example to show how our tiling scheme improved the performance of SuperGlue:

</p>

<p align="center">

As can be seen, the correspondences of SuperGlue are all wrong, while ours (SuperGlue combined with tiling scheme, followed by RANSAC) recovered a large number of good correspondences.

## Precise matching

We perform a precise matching under the guidance of the co-registered DSM.

We provide 2 options (guided matching and patch matching) to get tentative inter-epoch correspondences, then remove the outliers with 3D RANSAC and cross correlation.

### Get tentative inter-epoch correspondences
Guided matching is designed for hand-crafted methods like SIFT. We predict the keypoint locaiton from one epoch to another via the co-registered DSM, and search only the neighborhood of the predicted keypoint to reduce ambiguity.

Patch matching is designed for deep learning methods like SuperGlue. We use the co-registered DSM to predict the corresponding patches, followed with resampling to remove the scale and rotation difference. The patch pair will be feed into SuperGlue to get tentative correspondences.

### Get enhanced inter-epoch correspondences

We project the tentative correspondences onto respective DSMs to get 3D points, and remove outliers in a RANSAC routine based on 3D
spatial similarity model.

### Get final inter-epoch correspondences

We apply cross-correlation for final validation. Feature correspondences with their correlation scores below a predefined threshold
are discarded.
The rectangles in the picture below represent the cross-correlation window, false match (red) is eliminated, while true match (blue) is kept.

# Experiment

We test our method on a dataset with drastic scene changes displayed below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/1954.png" width="450">
</p>

<p align="center">
Figure. Epoch 1954
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/2014.png" width="450">
</p>

<p align="center">
Figure. Epoch 2014
</p>

We recover inter-epoch correspondences and refine the image orientations, then calculate DSMs in each epoch and adopt the conception of DoD (Difference of DSMs) for evaluation.

Ideally, the DoD should only display the scene changes as shown in the picture below.

<p align="center">

But in real case, a doom effect as shown below would appear due to poorly estimated camera parameters.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/RealDoD.png" width="600">
</p>

<p align="center">
Figure. DoD in real case
</p>

We display 4 sets of DoDs below.

(1) DoD resulted from orientations based on 3D helmert transformation using 3 manually measured GCPs. 

This DoD is for comparison. As can be seen, this DoD showed obvious doom effect as the camera parameters of epoch 1954 are poorly estimated;

(2) DoD resulted from orientations based on 3D helmert transformation using GCPs automatically recovered from our rough co-registration. 

The systematic error is mitigated thanks to our dense correspondences in DSMs;

(3) DoD resulted from orientations refined in bundle adjustment with our correspondences based on guided matching;

(4) DoD resulted from orientations refined in bundle adjustment with our correspondences based on patch matching.

In the DoD of (3) and (4), the doom effect is effectively mitigated while the real scene changes are kept, thanks to our numerous and precise inter-epoch correspondences.
