# Introduction

Historical images are a valuable source of information in analyzing the evolution of landscapes. To be able to fully exploit their potential, the images should be precisely calibrated with the help of feature correspondences.
Current state-of-the-art feature matching methods include SIFT (hand-crafted) and SuperGlue (deep learning). They work well on images within the same epoch (also refered to intra-epoch).
